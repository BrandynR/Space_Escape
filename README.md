Space Escape is my first attempt at simple, but complete game. This is my first project utilizing sound effects, particle systems, and automation (moving platforms). I wanted to build something simple with an easy learning cure for the Player, but make sure it was challenging enough to keep the player interested.

## Project Concept

While starting my AR/VR Specialization at Holberton School I started this side project as a means to build confidence and gain familiarity inside Unity3D. Testing and implementing new concepts and features such as Unity's particle system.
