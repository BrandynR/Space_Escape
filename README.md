**Space Escape** is my first attempt at simple, but complete game. This is my first project utilizing sound effects, particle systems, and automation (moving platforms). I wanted to build something simple with an easy learning cure for the Player, but make sure it was challenging enough to keep the player interested.
**Space Escape v2** was me trying different lighting, materials, and textures as well as adjusting the speed different obstacles throughout the levels.

## Project Concept

While starting my AR/VR Specialization at Holberton School I started this side project as a means to build confidence and gain familiarity inside Unity3D. Testing and implementing new concepts and features such as Unity's particle system. 


## How to Play

- Use the **arrow keys** to steer the Rocketship left or right.
- **Be careful** to avoid the obstacles, floor, and ceiling. 
- Hit the **spacebar** to add thrust to your Rocketship. 
- Land your Rocketship on the **Green platform** to advance to the next level.
- Test your skills as a pilot as you try and adavence through all **9 Levels!**
- **Have Fun and Good Luck!**
